# Description

This test plan is for verifying whether a theme converted by [Theme-Converter](https://github.com/microsoft/theme-converter/tree/main/ThemeConverter/ThemeConverter) will severely break the readability on common user workflows.
For each step, observe if the UI is readable under default/selected/hovered situation, when the window has focus and doesn't have focus.

# Prerequisites

VS 2022 Preview 3 or later, with the theme to be tested installed.
VS Code _(optional)_

### Note

Scenarios marked with **VS Code compare** in the title should be compared with VS Code to see if there's any obvious color mismatch.
